🎓 Admission Prediction Using Machine Learning

A data-driven approach to predict a student’s chance of admission to graduate programs using various academic and research features.

📌 Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the probability of a student's admission based on input features such as:

GRE Score

TOEFL Score

CGPA

SOP (Statement of Purpose)

LOR (Letter of Recommendation)

University Rating

Research Experience

The target variable is Chance of Admit, a value between 0 and 1.

🧠 Problem Statement

To develop a system that accurately predicts a student’s chances of being admitted to a graduate program using machine learning models trained on historical admission data.

👥 End Users

🎓 Students: Understand and improve their profile before applying.

🏫 Admission Committees: Make data-driven application evaluations.

📘 Educational Consultants: Offer personalized guidance to students.
